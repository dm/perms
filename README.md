## Nodes

A permission node grants a particular kind of access to a resource.

It should be formatted as follows

`[-]<resource>[.<sub_resource>...].<verb>`

The following are examples of good nodes

- `projects.webserver.build`
- `projects.webserver.chat.use`
- `projects.webserver.chat.moderate`


### Important Considerations

- Nodes are case sensitive
- Whitespaces are not allowed

### Wildcards

An asterisk or `*` may be used to signify a wildcard match.

The `*` node would match every permission


The `projects.*` node would match for

- `projects.*`
- `projects.webserver.test`
-  etc.

The `projects.*.chat.use` node would match for

- `projects.webserver.chat.use`
- `projects.database.chat.use`
- `projects.client.chat.use`

### Negations

A `-` prefixing a node signifies it's negated. Negation will be only be overwritten if the
user has the node explicitely defined. If the negation lies directly on the user, it must be removed
for the user to have access to the permission.


if Bob has 
- `*`
- `-projects.*`

He has access to

- `billing.budget.manage`

But not 

- `projects.webserver.use`

### List

The standard way to list nodes is to delimit them with whitespace. Redudent whitespaces are ignored.

The following lists are functionally identitical.

```
projects.publish projects.manage
```

```
projects.publish
projects.manage
```

use `ParseNodes()` to parse a list of nodes.

`Nodes.String()` return a newline delimited string of nodes.

## PConf
A built in permission system is provided via PConfs

Permissions takes one or more permissions configuration or `PConf`s and assembles a 
`Web`


`PConf`s are JSON and can look like any of the following.


```js
{
    "groups": {
        "project_lead": {
            "nodes": [
                "analytics.*"
            ]
        }
        "manager": {
            "parents": [
                "project_lead"
            ],
            "nodes": [
                "projects.*"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

```js
{
    "users": {
        "ammar": {
            "groups": [
                "manager",
            ],
            "nodes": [
                "-projects.*.chat.moderate",
            ],
        }
    }
}
```

or even

```js
	{
    "groups": {
        "project_lead": {
            "nodes": [
                "analytics.*"
            ]
        },
        "manager": {
            "parents": [
                "project_lead"
            ],
            "nodes": [
                "projects.*"
            ]
        }
    },
    "users": {
        "ammar": {
            "groups": [
                "manager"
            ],
            "nodes": [
                "-projects.*.chat.moderate"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

If multiple pconfs provide `users` over and over again, the internal user state will be appended to. If multiple pconfs declare the same user or group, only the last one will be used.

Groups do not have to be explicitely created to be referenced. 

The `default` group will be inherited by all users.
